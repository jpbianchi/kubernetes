  - Large size image: +20GB Docker image, includes almost all tools used on GitHub Actions (IMPORTANT: currently only ubuntu-18.04 platform is available)
  - Medium size image: ~500MB, includes only necessary tools to bootstrap actions and aims to be compatible with all actions
  - Micro size image: <200MB, contains only NodeJS required to bootstrap actions, doesn't work with all actions

Default image and other options can be changed manually in ~/.actrc (please refer to https://github.com/nektos/act#configuration for additional information about file structure)[0m  [36m[Use arrows to move, type to filter, ? for more help][0m
